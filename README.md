# WebGL-project

Creating an interactive canvas in WebGL with the algorithm *Polar of a BÃ©zier Curve*  studied in the course Geometric modeling.  


## Features Implemented in the Course Project  

1. **Mathematical Description of the Algorithm:**  
   A detailed mathematical explanation of the implemented algorithm is provided.  

2. **Program Functionality and Examples (User Guide):**  
   A comprehensive explanation of the program's functionality is included, along with examples and a detailed user guide.  


### Key Implementations:  
- The program allows **interactive selection of data on the screen**, enabling visual control over the curve's appearance. This feature highlights the capabilities of the geometric algorithms covered in the course.  
- Curves are drawn using the **de Casteljau algorithm**.  
- **Anti-aliasing** is implemented to improve visual quality.  
- Additional features have been incorporated to enhance visualization.
